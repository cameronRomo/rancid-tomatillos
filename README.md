## Project Overview

This was a Mod 3 project from Turing School of Software and Design. The goals were aimed towards getting experience with new concepts such as: React, React testing, webAPIs, JSX, and Jest. In addition there were opportunities to get more experience with CSS and git workflow.

## Goals
* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
* Practice refactoring
* Create a multi-page UX using Router
* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Ensure our app is following best practices for accessibility

* Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the site.
* Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Challenges
* Using React to develop an application, as opposed to using vanila JavaScript
* Using React testing library as well as the Jest testing library
* Utilizing GitHub Project board to organize work
* Using Component class inheritance
* Using React with hooks to update the state of a functional component 
* Using conditional rendering with JSX 
* Getting used to JSX syntax
* Using Router to keep the URL in sync with the UI

## Wins
* Success with atomic commits
* Good group communication and time scheduling
* Using issues with in conjunction with PR requests
* Consistency with PR templates
* Balance of work between group members
* Successful with self-teaching new tools
* Gained familiarity with React

## Roadmap
* With more time, we would like to enhance the UI/UX for:
  * User favorites
  * User reviews
  * Ability to create new account/user
  * Ability to authenticate users
* Add more sad path testing
